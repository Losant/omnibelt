# Changelog

Below should serve as an "upgrade guide" jumping off point as you are migrating projects to newer versions of this package. Ideally, interface changes will be called out specifically and one should not have to go sifting through git diffs to discern what changed.

- `?.?.?` - *WIP*
- `1.1.8`
   - Ability to generate a static documentation site that's hosted on GitHub pages.
- `1.1.7`
   - Added methods:
      - `ensureEndsWith`
- `1.1.6`
   - External changes:
      - `testHarness` and the like, no longer assume that `expect` is available in your environment through `jest`. Instead, you must pass `expect` in as a dependency. See [this issue](https://github.com/Losant/losant-utils/issues/40) for more info.
   - Internal changes:
      - linter update to `1.3.2`
      - tests for `equalsAny`
      - tests for `containsAll`
- `1.1.5`
   - Added methods:
      - `testHarness`
      - `testCases`
   - Internal changes:
      - Linter bumped and ran on project.
      - Tests for `evolveArray`.
- `1.1.4`
   - ⬆️ Ramda upgrade to `0.25.0`. Upgrade guide [here](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2319).
   - `tap` has been omitted from Ramda and implemented in this project to work around new version.
   - Added methods:
      - `toInteger` (Lodash)
   - Remove methods:
      - `testHarness`: Now is not exported as part of this library and is only used internally
   - Internal changes:
      - `test*` methods have been moved to `test/` and are only for internal use.
      - `testHarness` has been updated with a new interface. `testHarnessUnary` is still around for backwards compatibility.
      - `testCases` now exists to eliminate a common pattern when using `testHarness`.
- `1.1.3`
   - All internal Losant utilities now only require the specific function(s) they need from `ramda`/`lodash`.
   - The following methods are now pulled from Lodash instead of Ramda:
      - `forEach`: Note that `forEachObjIndexed` still comes from ramda (behaves as expected)
   - Removed methods:
      - `indexBy` from Ramda has been omitted in favor of `keyBy`
      - `parseInt` from Lodash has been omitted because it conflicts poorly with native
   - Added methods:
